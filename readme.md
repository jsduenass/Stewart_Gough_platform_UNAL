This repo documents the updating process of an Stewart Gough platform at Universidad Nacional de Colombia. This work is done as part of the final project of the class _Sensors and Actuators_ Semester 2021-II. 

## (tentative) Objectives
The project  has the following objectives:
* Update the platform and make it's system requirements compatible with a modern system (windows 10 - MATLAB2021a )
* Evaluate the impact of sensor quality on the performance of the system.


## Process

### Getting to know the system
The process started by getting acquittance with the platform. After an onsite visit of the platform, the team received the corresponding documentation and produced a [file](project_structure.txt) containing a log with every one of the files received.

```
find >  project_structure.txt
```
This analysis proof fruitful and provided a starting path '/ENTREGA-FINAL-RC-380-2011/CONTROLADORES/PRISMMATIC/cd/Software'
to begin the search.
